Market Requirements Document
----------------------------

This document describes the market requirements for a product

.. vertex:: MRD-001
    :layout: subtle

    This paragraph uses a 'subtle' layout that shows the vertex ID and its
    neighbours, without breaking the flow of the document

.. vertex:: MRD-002
    :layout: transparent

    This paragraph is also a sphinx-graph vertex and its contents and relationship
    to other vertices are tracked. However, it uses the 'transparent' layout, and
    its contents are embedded directly into the document when published.
