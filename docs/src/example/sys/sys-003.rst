SYS-003

.. vertex:: SYS-003
   :parents: USR-001

   this requirement is linked to a parent but isn't tracking that parent's 'fingerprint'.
   That's fine, but it means that if the parent is changed, Sphinx-Graph won't prompt you to review this requirement
   by returning a build warning with the new fingerprint.

   it has an embedded glossary term - :term:`Some Term`
