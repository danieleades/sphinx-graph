.. vertex:: SYS-003
   :parents: USR-001:abcde

   this requirement has a 'suspect' link to USR-001. It needs to be reviewed,
   and have the 'fingerprint' manually updated.

   This outdated fingerprint will trigger a build warning, with instructions on
   updating to the correct fingerprint. Updating a fingerprint signifies that
   the vertex has been reviewed, and it still satisfies the relationship to the updated
   parent.
