SYS-003
-------

.. vertex:: SYS-003
    :type: sys
    :parents: USR-001

    this requirement is linked to a parent but isn't tracking that parent's 'fingerprint'.
    That's fine, but it means that if the parent is changed, Sphinx-Graph won't prompt you to review this requirement
    by returning a build warning with the new fingerprint.

Ancestors
=========

.. vertex-table::
    :query: ancestors

    uid = "SYS-003"
