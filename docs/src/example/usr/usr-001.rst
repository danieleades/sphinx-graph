   this is high-level user requirement of some sort.

   It is derived from a specific paragraph of a market requirements document.
   If that paragraph is updated, the 'fingerprint' tracked by this vertex will
   be invalidated, triggering a review of this user requirement to ensure it
   still reflects the market requirements as intended.
